# GAS-LEVEL-MONITORING-AND-ALERT-SYSTEM-USING-IOT
The aim of this project is to monitor the Gas level in the cylinder and to give the alert signals to user's when the gas level drops threshold or leaks. I used Arduino-UNO, SIM900a,Load cell,HX711,gas sensor,flame sensorand display

 Description:
 Developing a Smart Gas Monitoring and Alert System using IoT to automate gas level tracking, enhance safety by detecting leaks, streamline refills, and improve user awareness.

 Conclusion: 
 This system ensures efficient gas usage, early leak detection, and seamless booking, enhancing safety and convenience for users.
